# Amigo CSS

Amigo CSS is a simple, custom-first and intuitive CSS framework for CSS lovers. The inspiration to create Amigo CSS came
from my desire to have a specific set of procedures or a system that would
help me to easily create websites. After building so many websites you
start noticing a trend of the same things you normally do. For example, doing CSS resets,
coming up with a typography and spacing system, picking specific colors, etc.

Amigo CSS was originally created to solve that personal problem but all
of a sudden I realized that I could make this open source.

So here is my first open source project - Amigo CSS

## FAQ

#### How do I use Amigo CSS on my project?

The easiest way I recommend is just grab this URL from the CDN and add
it to your project.

```

#### Does Amigo CSS use NPM?

Yes! We are on NPM. Install Amigo CSS with npm...

```bash
